This triangle identification program identifies the type of a triangle
when given numbers that represent the lengths of each of its sides. 
It is used by traders to buy and sell high value triangles

The program is accessed via a web browser that displays a page inviting
 the user to type three positive integers (whole numbers). These
 integers may be keyed into three separate fields on the web page or
 entered into a single field with spaces separating the numbers.
 
When the user clicks ‘submit’ or presses the ‘return’ key, the program
takes these integers to be the lengths of each side of a triangle and
identifies the type of triangle by responding with one of the following
messages:
•   Equilateral
•   Isosceles
•   Scalene
•   Not a triangle

Below the message, the user is prompted to type in three more positive
integers.

The following additional options are available:
1.  Data can be read from a file or files by selecting the ‘read from
file’ button.  Within the file the numbers in a line must be separated
by a single white space
2.  Comments can include on a line by starting the comment with a ‘#’
marker
3.  The program can be stopped by pressing the ‘quit’ button
